      ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Awowole Hammad Olamilekan, a passionate frontend web developer who loves building immersive and user-friendly online experiences.

      I bring ideas to life with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript, and I often use React to create dynamic, responsive, and engaging interfaces. 
      I also enjoy working with APIs to add powerful features and improve user interactions.
      <br />
      For collaboration and code management, I rely on Git & GitHub, while deployment platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel help me share my projects with the world.
      <br />
      ðŸš€ My goal is simple: to craft websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing and seamless to use.
